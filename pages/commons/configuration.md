Configuration is easily possible directly from in-game using the mod menu (requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) by [Prospector](https://modrinth.com/user/Prospector) to be installed on Fabric) by installing [Forge Config Screens](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge).

When it comes to manual configuration all files are found at `.minecraft/config`, named as `MOD_ID-client.toml`, `MOD_ID-common.toml`, or `MOD_ID-server.toml` depending on the type of config. Not all types might exist for this mod if any.

Note that on older mod versions server configuration files are found at `.minecraft/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs`, effecticely meaning they must be configured separately for each individual world.
