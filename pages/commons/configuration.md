If available for this mod, configuration is possible directly from in-game using the mod menu (requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) by [Prospector](https://modrinth.com/user/Prospector) to be installed on Fabric). Note that on older Minecraft versions installing [Forge Config Screens](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge) is also a requirement.

For manual configuration using an external text editor all files are found at `.minecraft/config`, named as `MOD_ID-client.toml`, `MOD_ID-common.toml`, or `MOD_ID-server.toml` depending on the type of config. Not all types might exist for a mod, if any at all.
