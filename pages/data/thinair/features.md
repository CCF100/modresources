+ Below Y=0 and above Y=128, and in the Nether, you slowly lose air

+ You can protect yourself with Potions of Free Breathing (which were renamed from Water Breathing), or with Respirators and Air Bladders
+ Create little pockets of tepid safety for yourself with Soul Fire, Soul Torches, or Soul Campfires. Or, restore your lungs with a Bottle of Soulfire
+ Safety Lanterns change color in your inventory and in the world to tell you the air quality around you. Or dye them for decoration!
+ Drowned will choke the air out of you on attacking
+ And as a fun bonus, right-click a torch to make it spew particles, perhaps to signal the exit to a cave
