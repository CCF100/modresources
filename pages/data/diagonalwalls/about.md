Diagonal Walls is the final addition to the diagonal blocks mod serires: At last not just fences and glass panes, but also walls are able to connect when placed diagonally. Finally you can build the castle of your dreams without limits.

Please note that for technical reasons when installing the Diagonal Walls mod walls are no longer able to connect upwards and will once again show gaps when stacked vertically (like they used to in Minecraft 1.15.2 and before). Adding that feature back is unfortunatly not technically feasible and is not planned.

Blocks added by other mods are dynamically supported whenever possible. Blocks that are affected unintentionally can be prevented from being so by adding them to the `diagonalwalls:non_diagonal_walls` block tag.
