Armor Statues unlocks the full potential of armor stands: Customize everything from unlocking arms, rotating every single body part, to selecting from built-in poses, adjusting various style settings, as well as great tools for positioning the armor stand, even in ways where you can use it to only display items in your world, making the stand itself invisible.

And the best part: This mod works on vanilla servers that do not have it installed! If a server does not have this mod, but has the [Vanilla Tweaks: Armor Statues](https://vanillatweaks.net/) data pack installed, this mod when installed on your client can serve as a replacement for the book normally used for controlling the data pack features. To use this functionality make sure to manually enable the `use_vanilla_tweaks_triggers` config option. Also if you are a server operator you do not even need the data pack on your server, Armor Statues will simply work by sending vanilla commands in the background.
