+ Switching between items in your hotbar does not trigger the attack cooldown.
+ Missing a hit on a target will not trigger the attack cooldown (disabled by default).
+ Attacks when the cooldown is too low can be disabled.
+ Hold your attack button to repeatedly attack (disabled by default).
+ Swords, hoes, and tridents have an increased attack reach, meaning you can hit targets from further away (the default attack reach is not decreased though as in combat test snapshots, it remains at 3.0 instead of 2.5 blocks).
+ Tiny mobs such as fish, rabbits, silverfish and baby mobs have their hitbox inflated to at least 0.9 blocks.
+ Sweep attacks require the sweeping edge enchantment, they also only deal half the damage they normally do, and are dealt even when missing your target (meaning when hitting air).
+ Shields properly knock back attackers (actually a bug fix).
+ Stack sizes for snow balls, eggs, and potions are incerased.
+ Drinking items such as potions, milk, and bottled liquids is much faster.
+ A very brief delay is added to throwing eggs and snowballs.
+ Eating and drinking are interrupted when being attacked.
+ Shields become usable after activation without any delay (it is usally 0.25 seconds in vanilla).
+ Shield protection arc is decreased to 100 degress.
+ Being hit by a projectile no longer grants brief damage immunity.
+ Sprinting does not stop when hitting a target, especially nice when fighting while swimming (since swimming is just sprinting, but in water).
+ Certain items such as totems of undying can be hidden when passivly held in the offhand.
+ Using a shield shows an indicator similar to the attack cooldown indicator.
