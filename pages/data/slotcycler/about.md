Slot Cycler is great when nine hotbar slots just aren't enough for you: Now you can quickly swap a hotbar slot with the items in the same inventory column. Very useful for swapping out tools or different weapons on the fly! To see what item will come up next just look to the right of your hotbar, where a new display is added.

You can either use two keys (`G` and `H` by default) to cycle forward or backward, use the mouse wheel while holding the `Alt` key (configurable), or press the hotbar key of the currently selected slot again (`1` to `9` in vanilla).
