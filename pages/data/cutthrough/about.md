Cut Through allows you to swing your weapon through tall grass and all other blocks without a collision shape when fighting an enemy. No longer are you forced to break the grass in your way to hit your target. Additionally Cut Through is extremly efficient with a negligible amount of additional calculations over vanilla compared to similar mods and works great with many other mods that rely on Minecraft's hit target implementation.
