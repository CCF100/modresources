+ Tridents finally have a crafting recipe! All three elder guardian in an ocean monument will each drop a new trident fragment item. Combine those three with a few prismarine shards, and there's your brand new trident!
+ Use a few prismarine shards to repair your trident in an anvil when it is about to run out of durability.
+ Tridents always return to the slot they are thrown from when picked up again.
+ When enchanted with loyalty, tridents accidentally thrown into the void return instead of being deleted from your world.
+ Any loot dropped by mobs including items and experience points will come flying at you together with any loyalty enchanted trident.
+ Impaling works as it does on Bedrock Edition: Any mob in contact with water or rain will receive increased damage, not just selected types of aquatic mobs.
