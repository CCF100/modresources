+ There are three tiers of bags of holding: leather, iron, and gold. The only difference is the number of slots they offer, which is 9, 27, 54 respectively (this can be changed in the config).
+ Use a bag by opening the dedicated menu screen, or directly from your inventory via simple interactions, check it out!
+ Like with the vanilla's bundles, click other items on a bag item in your inventory or the other way around to insert and extract contents to / from the bag.
+ Nicely see what's inside a bag item on the tooltip. Hold the `Alt` key to force the bag tooltip to render, even when your cursor is carrying another item or the bag itself. Great when interacting to keep track of the bag contents you are inserting into / extracting from.
+ While hovering over a bag item, use your scroll wheel to select to slot you want to interact with. You are no longer bound to extracting the last item first.
+ When scrolling through the bag tooltip like that, a second tooltip will appear to the left side of the bag item for the slot in the bag tooltip you have currently selected. Great for e.g. distinguishing enchanted tools from each other!
+ While carrying a bag item with your cursor, right-click + drag across multiple slots to insert items into the bag or extract items from it when the dragged across slots are empty.
+ Hold the `Ctrl` key (`Cmd` on Mac) to enter precision mode; instead of inserting / extracting whole stacks only a single item will be moved. Use the scroll wheel to quickly get to a specific amount.
+ Observe a tiny indicator on bag items when your cursor is holding an item, telling you if the item can be added and if the bag already contains items of that type.
+ Enchant your bag with preservation to prevent it from dropping abd being lost on your death. The enchantment level is reduced by one each time.
