+ All animals are now able to despawn and respawn as they please. They will no longer only be spawned once upon world generation. In addition to no longer being punished for killing too many animals in an area, this also enables interesting mechanics such as passive mob farms.
+ To prevent a few game mechanics from breaking, animals now automatically gain persistence (a vanilla mechanic preventing any mob from despawning) when: ridden by the player, named with a name tag, bred or born as a result of breeding, and when tamed by the player.
+ In case the changes to animal spawning mechanics break the behavior of another mod, a blacklist for individual animals can be found in the config file.
+ The mod behavior is controllable on a per world basis via the use of the custom `persistentAnimals` game rule. When the game rule is set to `false` this mod will take effect, which is the case for every world created with Respawnable Animals installed. For old existing worlds make sure to manually run the `/gamerule persistentAnimals false` command once to allow the mod to work.
