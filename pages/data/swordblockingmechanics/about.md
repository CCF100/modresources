Sword Blocking Mechanics restores the very useful blocking ability to all swords straight from the Minecraft 1.7 / 1.8 combat era. What more is there to say really? It's just as equally awesome as it was back in the day. Simply right-click your held sword and 50% of all incoming damage will be blocked. Really easy to use and much more convenient than bulky shields. You still want to ocasionally use a shield though? No problem! When held in the offhand it will be prioritized over sword blocking. 

Everything about sword blocking is fully customizable, and there even is a new parry mechanic. It is active in the first 0.5 seconds after initiating a sword block, where the block is more similar to a shield and prevents all incoming damage.

Any item that is to support the sword blocking mechanic must be added to the `swordblockingmechanics:can_perform_sword_blocking` item tag. Items you want to use from your offhand while holding a sword in the mainhand should be added to the `swordblockingmechanics:overrides_sword_blocking_in_offhand` item tag.

For bringing back not the old sword blocking mechanic, but also just fast paced combat, make sure to check out [Golden Age Combat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/golden-age-combat).
