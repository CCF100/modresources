Easy Shulker Boxes brings some extremely useful changes to shulker boxes, making them usable from directly within your inventory. No need for placing the whole box on the ground for checking contents or adding a few item stacks! When you want to extract an item, easily scroll through all items in the box to get what you want.

And believe it or not, this whole system is driven by data packs! This allows essentially any item to be supported, by default this is the case for ender chests, as well as some selected backpacks and shulker boxes from other mods.
