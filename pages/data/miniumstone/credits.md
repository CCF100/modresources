+ Thanks a lot to [Pahimar](https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/Pahimar) and [X3n0ph0b3](https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/x3n0ph0b3) for originally coming up with the concept of the Philosopher's Stone for their old [Equivalent Exchange 2](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1282288-1-2-5-equivalent-exchange-2-v1-4-6-7) mod. The Minium Stone mod mostly represents a reimplementation of said item for modern Minecraft versions.
+ The sounds used for certain minium stone actions are taken from the [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte) by [SinKillerJ](https://www.curseforge.com/members/SinKillerJ) under the conditions of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.
+ The textures used for the items in this mod are taken from the [RetroExchange](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/retroexchange) by [modmuss50](https://www.curseforge.com/members/modmuss50) under the conditions of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.
+ Parts of the block selection appearance and behavior are loosely adapted from the [FTB Ultimine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-ultimine-forge) mod by [FTB](https://www.curseforge.com/members/FTB).
