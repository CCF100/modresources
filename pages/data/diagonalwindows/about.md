Diagonal Windows is a simple mod: Now all types of glass panes and iron bars are able to connect diagonally! So what are you waiting for? Let's get building!

Blocks added by other mods are dynamically supported whenever possible. Works great in combination with the [Diagonal Fences](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diagonal-fences) mod.
