Diagonal Windows is a simple mod: Now all types of glass panes and iron bars are able to connect diagonally! So what are you waiting for? Let's get building!

Blocks added by other mods are dynamically supported whenever possible. Blocks that are affected unintentionally can be prevented from being so by adding them to the `diagonalwindows:non_diagonal_windows` block tag.

Check out the two other projects from the diagonal blocks mod family: [Diagonal Fences](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diagonal-fences) and [Diagonal Walls](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diagonal-walls).
