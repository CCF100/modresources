Diagonal Fences makes all kinds of fences able to connect diagonally. Works just like you would expect it to, so not much more to say really.

Blocks added by other mods are dynamically supported whenever possible. Blocks that are affected unintentionally can be prevented from being so by adding them to the `diagonalfences:non_diagonal_fences` block tag.

Works great in combination with mods such as [Diagonal Windows](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diagonal-windows) and [Macaw's Fences and Walls](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/macaws-fences-and-walls) by [Sketch_Macaw](https://www.curseforge.com/members/sketch_macaw).
