Golden Age Combat is here to save Minecraft's combat by serving as a faithful recreation of Minecraft 1.8's old combat mechanics for modern versions without any compromises. So say goodbye to the attack cooldown and hello spam clicking!

From removing the infamous attack cooldown along with all traces such as animations and tooltips, over various small querks in combat oriented game mechanics to even very minor animations; this mod has it all!

For bringing back not just fast paced combat, but also the old sword blocking mechanic, make sure to check out [Sword Blocking Mechanics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sword-blocking-mechanics).

Please note that Golden Age Combat is designed purely for an experience in singleplayer or on modded servers. Playing on vanilla servers, especially competitive ones, is not possible and won't be supported.
