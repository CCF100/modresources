Forge Config API Port is a modding library for mod developers that provides both NeoForge's & Forge's whole config system to other modding ecosystems. Allows developers to use NeoForge configs on Fabric & Forge and Forge configs on Fabric & NeoForge.

The library is built with a multiloader architecture in mind by also offering a mod loader independent common distribution, so there needs to be as little platform specific code as possible.
