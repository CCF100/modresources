Resource Pack Overrides is configured via a single config file located at `.minecraft/config/resourcepackoverrides.json`. The file does **NOT** generate when absent. You do have to create it manually.

Resource Pack Overrides has two main features which can be managed in the mentioned file: 
+ Defining a default list and order of resource packs.
+ Overriding certain resource pack display attributes for the resource pack selection list.
