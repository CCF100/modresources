Mindful Darkness does not automatically darken every gui texture in the game, instead you have to manually specify in the config which textures are affected. Resources can be specified using '*' as wildcard char, can affect all or just a single namespace and you can use '!' to exclude resources.

By default, configuration looks like this: "`textures/gui/*.png`, `!minecraft:textures/gui/icons.png`". This will include all textures in the `textures/gui` directory from all namespaces (since this is where mods ususally put their gui textures). Specifically for the `minecraft` namespace `icons.png` is excluded though (indicated by adding '!' at the beginning). NOTE: The order of defining resources matters for exclusions! Excluded resources need to come after any entry that would otherwise include them.
