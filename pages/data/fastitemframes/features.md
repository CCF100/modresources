+ Item Frames are now blocks instead of entities, improving performance.
+ Reduced lag when rendering and updating item frames. Having many in one place no longer lowers FPS as much.
+ Breaking item frames now shows proper particles and works with block-related commands like `/setblock`.
+ Item frames instantly react when their supporting block is broken or when interacting with pistons.
+ No downsides: You can still place multiple frames in the same block space.
+ Fully compatible with older versions: Existing item frame entities automatically change into blocks when loaded.
+ You can dye item frames like leather items, with access to 5,713,438 unique colors.
+ Shift + right-click with an empty hand to make an item frame invisible, leaving only the item inside visible.
