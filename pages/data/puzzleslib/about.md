Puzzles Lib is the core library that all my mods need to run. What does it do you ask? Most importantly it offers a bunch of abstractions for mod loader-specific code, which makes it very easy for me to develop all of my mods on multiple mod loaders simultaneously.

Note that Puzzles Lib is specifically designed for my own needs, it is not intended to be used by other developers. Other developers are welcome to adapt my implementations for their own needs though.
