+ The bartering station hands out gold to up to 6 piglins in range every 15 seconds.
+ For bartering with more than 6 piglins simultaneously, just setup more bartering stations!
+ One ingot is taken from a single slot per cycle, so spread out your gold across all slots!
+ If your gold is not being spent, move the piglins closer!
+ The station collects all results from bartering and will stop working when all those slots are filled.
