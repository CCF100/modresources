Nether Chest adds a very unique new chest: Not only has this single chest as many slots as a full double chest, but it can also store way more items in each slot! Every slot can hold 8 times as many items as normally of every stackable item. So where any normal inventory just stores 64 items in a slot, your new nether chest can store a total of 512.
