+ Only ever uses two colors: the vanilla base color + orange / light blue. A tiny number to the side tells you how many layers are stacked on top instead of making you guess from the current color.
+ Stacks hearts on top of each other when you have more than 10 hearts. The stacked layer will always show as orange.
+ Stack armor points on top of each other when you have more than 20 points. The stacked layer shows light blue.
+ Adds a display for armor toughness right above the food bar, behaves just like the armor bar (can be moved left if you prefer).
+ Also fixes incoming chat messages to no longer hide the armor bar.
+ Fully configurable! Change stacking behavior, number display and so much more!
+ Install [AttributeFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/attributefix) by [DarkhaxDev](https://www.curseforge.com/members/DarkhaxDev) to properly support armor and toughness values above 20.
