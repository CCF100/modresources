+ Adds new tiers of bundles: Leather, Copper, Iron, Gold, Diamond, Netherite with a much improved way to use all of them!
+ Upgrade your old bundle to the next tier in a smithing table, no smithing template required!
+ And now the juicy stuff, the new ways of using your bundles!
+ Like with the original bundles, click other items on the bundle item in your inventory or the other way around to insert and extract contents to / from the bundle.
+ Nicely see what's inside a bundle item on the tooltip. Hold the `Alt` key to force the bundle tooltip to render, even when your cursor is carrying another item or the bundle itself. Great when interacting to keep track of the bundle contents you are inserting into / extracting from.
+ While hovering over a bundle item, use your scroll wheel to select to slot you want to interact with. You are no longer bound to extracting the last item first.
+ When scrolling through the bundle tooltip like that, a second tooltip will appear to the left side of the bundle item for the slot in the bundle tooltip you have currently selected. Great for e.g. distinguishing enchanted tools from each other!
+ While carrying a bundle item with your cursor, right-click + drag across multiple slots to insert items into the bundle or extract items from it when the dragged across slots are empty.
+ Hold the `Ctrl` key (`Cmd` on Mac) to enter precision mode; instead of inserting / extracting whole stacks only a single item will be moved. Use the scroll wheel to quickly get to a specific amount.
+ Observe a tiny indicator on bundle items when your cursor is holding an item, telling you if the item can be added and if the bundle already contains items of that type.
