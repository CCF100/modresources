+ Adds new tiers of bundles: Leather, Copper, Iron, Gold, Diamond, Netherite with a much improved way to use all of them!
+ While hovering over a bundle item, use your scroll wheel to select to slot you want to itneract with. You are no longer bound to extracting the last item first.
+ When scrolling through the bundle tooltip like that, a second tooltip will appear to the left side of the bundle item for the slot in the bundle tooltip you have currently selected. Great for distinguishing enchanted tools from each other!
+ While carrying a bundle item with your cursor, click + drag across multiple slots to insert items into the bundle or extract items from the bundle when the dragged across slots are empty.
+ Hold the `Ctrl` key (`Cmd` on Mac) to enable precision mode, instead of inserting / extracting whole stacks only a single item will be moved. Use the scroll wheel for a specific amount.
+ Hold the `Alt` key to force the bundle tooltip to render, even when your cursor is carrying another item or a bundle itself. Great when interacting to keep track of the bundle contents you are inserting into / extracting from.
+ Oberserve a tiny indicator on bundle items when your cursor is holding an item, telling you if the item can be added and if the bundle already contains items of that type.
