Night Config Fixes exists for the sole purpose of implementing a workaround for the rather common `com.electronwill.nightconfig.core.io.ParsingException: Not enough data available` issue related to config loading when using the [Night Config](https://github.com/TheElectronWill/night-config) library (used by Forge's config system, as well as many mods on Fabric).

There have been daily reports mentioning this issue for the Better Minecraft mod packs, which feels common enough to provide a dedicated workaround mod.
