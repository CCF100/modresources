Visual Workbench even works with crafting tables added by other mods. Support has to be manually enabled per block though. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at `.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json` (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely just not possible to be supported by this mod.
